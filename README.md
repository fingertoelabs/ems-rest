# ems-rest
Inspired by Malcom Spark's excelent London Clojurians talk,  I am attempting to make a nice reusable rest stack from the ground up so that I understand the full process of what is going on.

Clojure has a "Simple made Easy" mindset, but my goal is "Easy Made Simple".  Thus EMS Rest server.

https://www.rest.guide/README.html is my starting point.

This is my own experiment.  Feel free to experiment along, comment on my silly errors, make suggestions etc, but use at you own risk.
